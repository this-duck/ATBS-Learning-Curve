# ATBS-Learning-Curve
A collection of projects from and related to my learning Python from Al Sweigart's Automate the Boring Stuff book. 

Started this process in April 2020 during COVID-19.
Began to write outside of Mu on 13/05/2020. Thought this would be a better place to work on the projects. 

Update 22/06/2020. Hadn't bothered using git, and so am back here to make a go of things.

PROJECTS:
1. Sandwich Maker. (ATBS Ch.8)
